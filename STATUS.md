# STATUS — Verified vs. Unverified

---

## VERIFIED — automated tests

**110 passed** on `feature/bounded-multi-step-planner` (Termux / S25).

---

## MEASURED — Stage-1 concurrency (frozen)

Concurrent writers UNSUPPORTED (chain broken, fail closed). Single writer SUPPORTED.

---

## MEASURED — Stage-2 software durability

clean recover · torn line fail closed.

---

## MEASURED — Physical SIGKILL (n=3 valid)

| Run | recovered_ok | count | notes |
|-----|--------------|-------|-------|
| #1 | true | 2226 | manifest running |
| #2 | true | 2810 | manifest running |
| #3 | true | 1127 | manifest running; dir `03b` |
| #4–#5 | pending | — | — |

Ctrl+C attempt discarded (`clean_stop`).  
**claim:** 3/3 valid measured SIGKILL recoveries verified. Not a reliability rate; not power-loss.
